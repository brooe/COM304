  I've been a hobbyist computer enthusiast for my entire childhood, adolesence, and adult life - growing up disassembling consoles and controllers and trying to put them back together again before I'd get in trouble. I only really became interested in software once I realised I could mod games, and taught myself how to do so. I started learning to program on my own as a pre-teen, and have continued to do so on-and-off ever since.
