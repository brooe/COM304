## session 1

- Setting up GitHub, cloning the repository, creating a project plan

## session 2

- History of Computing :

  - Digital computers come from a long legacy of mechanical and analogue computing devices (ex. babbage machine, gaudi cathedral model)
        <sub>https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/charles-babbages-difference-engines-and-science-museum, https://www.livescience.com/20718-computer-history.html</sub>
  - The Turing Machine, invented in 1936, was foundational for the modern computer
    - a "turing complete" machine is that can simulate any other "turing complete" machine - this allows for emulation and virtualization.
  - The Manchester Atlas was built in 1962, and was one of the first supercomputers.
    - it introduced various new design concepts now ubiquitous in computing, such as piplining, virtual storage, job scheduling, and multiprogramming. 
  - Moore's Law: the number of transistors on microchips doubles every year <sub>https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/moores-law.html</sub>
      - has held true since the 1970s, but may not for much longer due to the limitations of physics.
   
- GitHub Clone & Merge :

    - Installed GIT on personal laptop, generated SSH keys
    - Cloned my forked repository, and merged it with the upstream
 
- Computer Architecture :

  - Binary Arithmetic
      - Binary is a base-2 system for representing numbers. It uses 2 symbols to represent
      -
    
  - Boolean Logic :
      <sub>https://computer.howstuffworks.com/boolean.htm, https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zqp9kqt/revision/1, </sub>
     - Boolean logic is a form of algebra where all possible expressions can be evaluated as either True or False. In computers, this is translated to the output state of an electronic circuit, which is either 0 (False) or 1 (True) (and as such can also be represented in binary). 
       - We evaluate these using Boolean conditions.
       - AND: where BOTH inputs are True, output True, else False.
       - NOT: INVERTS the input. Where input is True, output False. Where input is False, output True.
       - OR: where EITHER input is True, output True. if BOTH inputs are False, output False.
    - Logic gates are a series of transistors connected together to give one or more outputs, each output being based on the input or combination of inputs supplied to it.
