**NOTE**

For each of the sessions, bullet point notes on what you have learnt.
Use markdown references and / or links to resources you have used
use  screen shots and / or code samples as appropriate.

## session 1

- Setting up GitHub, cloning the repository, creating a project plan

## session 2

- History of Computing :

  - Digital computers come from a long legacy of mechanical and analogue computing devices (ex. babbage machine, gaudi cathedral model)
  - The Turing Machine, invented in 1936, was foundational for the modern computer
    - a "turing complete" machine is that can simulate any other "turing complete" machine - this allows for emulation and virtualization.
  - The Manchester Atlas was built in 1962, and was one of the first supercomputers.
    - it introduced various new design concepts now ubiquitous in computing, such as piplining, virtual storage, job scheduling, and multiprogramming. 
  - Moore's Law: the number of transistors on microchips doubles every year
      - has held true since the 1970s, but may not for much longer due to the limitations of physics.
   
- GitHub Clone & Merge :

    - Installed GIT on personal laptop, generated SSH keys
    - Cloned my forked repository, and merged it with the upstream
